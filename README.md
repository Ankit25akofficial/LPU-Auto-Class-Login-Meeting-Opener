## üöÄ Features

-   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.
-   **Scheduled Execution:** Set a specific time (in HH:MM format) for the script to automatically log in.
-   **Secure Credential Storage:** Uses the `keyring` library to securely store your username and password in your operating system's native credential manager (e.g., Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain). Your password is never stored in plain text.
-   **One-Click Testing:** Instantly test the login and meeting-opening process without waiting for the scheduled time.
-   **Status Updates:** The GUI provides real-time feedback on the script's progress, from scheduling to successful login or errors.
-   **Automated Browser Control:** Uses Selenium to handle browser interactions, fill in forms, and click buttons seamlessly.
